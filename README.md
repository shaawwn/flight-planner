Flight Plan Waypoint Checklist

Small app that I'm creating to use with MS Flight Simulator to keep track of navlog waypoints instead of having to use the ingame menu. Solely for immersion purposes.  Basically a clone of the navlog in MS Flight Simulator but that doesn't take up screen real estate in the game UI.
